# Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
(_Model Evaluation and Validation_)

In this project, I evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about the monetary value of a home. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

## Data

The Boston Housing dataset contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater
Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Features
* RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
* LSTAT: percentage of population considered lower status
* PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town

Target Variable 4. 
* MEDV: median value of owner-occupied homes

## Model
The model uses a Decision Tree Algorithm. The work is done on a template Jupyter Notebook provided by Udacity. The code is written in Python 3 using NumPy and Pandas.
